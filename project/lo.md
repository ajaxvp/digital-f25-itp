# Learning Objectives
 * Phase 1
    * Print text to the screen.
    * Use multiple calls to `print` to print text to the screen over many lines.
 * Phase 2
    * Declare a variable.
    * Print text and variables to the screen with a single `print` call (not using f-strings).
    * Use other variables to calculate new values.
 * Phase 3
    * Receive input from the user and store that content in a variable.
    * Recognize that the `input` function returns a string and must be converted to an `int` for usage in the program.
 * Phase 4
    * Use an `if` statement to check for a condition in the program.
    * Know when to use an `elif` statement and why it might be useful to have instead of a separate `if`.
